## Sample Project

The `sample_project/` directory replaces the previous Django-only example with a
neutral, multi-language workspace:

- `backend/service.py` – Simple Python service with a tiny in-memory model.
- `frontend/App.jsx` – React component mirroring the backend task list.
- `infra/pipeline.yaml` – CI workflow that demonstrates invoking the CLI inside
  a GitHub Actions job.
- `scripts/build.sh` – Shell entry point that would wire backend and frontend
  build steps together.

Running `python -m zscripts collect --types all --project-root sample_project`
illustrates how Zscripts walks the different stacks using the same command.
