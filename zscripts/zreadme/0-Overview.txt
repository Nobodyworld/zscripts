# Zscripts

Zscripts is a framework-agnostic utility for aggregating source files into
navigable logs. The toolchain helps multi-stack teams surface Python, JavaScript,
TypeScript, CSS, shell scripts, infrastructure YAML, and other assets in a
consistent format so they can audit or ship documentation more quickly.

The repository ships with a configurable command line interface, templates for
regenerating this README, and a sample project that mixes backend, frontend, and
infrastructure code to highlight cross-stack coverage.

## Repository Layout

- **sample_project/** – Mixed-language reference project that demonstrates how
  the scanners traverse Python, JavaScript, shell, and YAML sources.
- **zscripts/** – Python package containing the CLI, configuration loader, and
  supporting utilities.
- **zscripts.config.json** – Default configuration file consumed by the CLI and
  helper modules.
- **README.md** – Autogenerated documentation (built from files within
  `zscripts/zreadme/`).
