## CLI Workflow

The CLI bundles the most common automation routines under `python -m zscripts`.
Each command respects the configuration file described above.

```text
usage: python -m zscripts [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--project-root PROJECT_ROOT] {collect,consolidate,tree} ...
```

### `collect`
Generate per-directory logs for one or more stacks. The command accepts a
comma-separated list of stacks (`python`, `html`, `css`, `js`, `python_html`, or
`all`).

```bash
python -m zscripts collect --types python,js --project-root sample_project
```

Logs are written to the directories declared in `collection_logs`.

### `consolidate`
Create a single file that merges all sources for the requested stack.

```bash
python -m zscripts consolidate --types python --output /tmp/project-python.txt
```

When no output file is supplied, the command falls back to the
`single_targets` configuration entry.

### `tree`
Snapshot the repository structure and inline the content of tracked files.

```bash
python -m zscripts tree --project-root sample_project --output /tmp/tree.txt
```

This is useful when you need a contextual code review bundle or want to capture
changes across multiple stacks in a single artifact.
