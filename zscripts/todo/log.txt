character_app_(character/models.py)|**potential enhancements:**|- **Profile Image Default Path:** Use a callable to generate dynamic defaults if needed.
common_app_(common/models.py)|**suggestions:**|- **Slug Handling:** Automated slug generation in the `save` method is good. Ensure that this method handles collisions if slugs can be non-unique due to edits.
common_app_(common/models.py)|**suggestions:**|- **Notification Model:** It’s well set up. Consider adding methods to bulk mark notifications as read.
common_app_(common/models.py)|**potential enhancements:**|- **Abstract Interaction Model:** Consider implementing actual derived models if this abstraction is being used. For example, actual `Post`, `Comment`, or `Follow` models should exist, ensuring they use this base properly.
content_app_(content/models.py)|**suggestions:**|- **Abstract Base Model:** Good use of an abstract base model to avoid repeating fields.
content_app_(content/models.py)|**suggestions:**|- **Direct References:** Ensure that `CharacterContent` properly references the `Character` model, and that your `ForeignKey` fields are correctly defined, especially the `related_name` for reverse lookups.
content_app_(content/models.py)|**potential enhancements:**|- **Handling of Media:** For `CharacterImage`, ensure you have set up media URLs and storage correctly, similar to the character model’s suggestions.
core_app_(core/models.py)|**suggestions:**|- **UserProfile Model:** Linking directly to the user model and extending it with a one-to-one relationship is a best practice. Good implementation here.
core_app_(core/models.py)|**suggestions:**|- **GlobalSettings Model:** Ensure there’s error handling for when keys do not exist.
core_app_(core/models.py)|**potential enhancements:**|- **Use of Signals:** For user profile creation, consider using signals to automatically create user profiles upon user creation if not already in place.
feed,_home,_and_landingpage_apps|**general observation:**|- Your usage of models across these apps seems consistent. However, ensure there is a real need to separate these concerns, as sometimes, too much separation can lead to fragmentation and harder maintainability.
leveling_app_(leveling/models.py)|**suggestions:**|- **Complex Relationship Handling:** Your models handle complex relationships well, especially between characters, attributes, and skills. Ensure your database indexes support your most common queries to optimize performance.
leveling_app_(leveling/models.py)|**potential enhancements:**|- **Model Methods:** For methods like `add_experience`, ensure that transaction handling is robust and consider edge cases around racing conditions.
metrics_app_(metrics/models.py)|**suggestions:**|- **Comprehensive Metrics Model:** The comprehensive setup to track various metrics is excellent. Ensure you have corresponding methods to update these metrics efficiently.
metrics_app_(metrics/models.py)|**suggestions:**|- **Database Indexing:** Given the potential size and frequency of queries on metrics, ensure appropriate indexes are in place.
metrics_app_(metrics/models.py)|**potential enhancements:**|- **Caching Strategy:** For frequently accessed but rarely changed data (like metrics summaries), consider implementing a caching strategy to reduce database load.
common_app_signals_(`common/signals.py`)|**review:**|- The approach to generating unique slugs for `Category` and `Tag` upon creation and update is correct and uses best practices such as using signals for automation.
common_app_signals_(`common/signals.py`)|**review:**|- Logging upon deletion helps maintain an audit trail, which is good practice, especially for traceability and debugging.
common_app_signals_(`common/signals.py`)|**suggestions:**|- **Error Handling:** Good use of logging errors when slug updates fail. Ensure these logs are monitored and actionable.
common_app_signals_(`common/signals.py`)|**suggestions:**|- **Performance:** When generating unique slugs, consider caching existing slugs to reduce database hits.
core_app_signals_(`core/signals.py`)|**review:**|- Automatic creation of `UserProfile` upon user creation is a best practice, ensuring data consistency and reducing the overhead of manual profile management.
core_app_signals_(`core/signals.py`)|**review:**|- The structure and comments are clear and helpful for maintaining the code.
core_app_signals_(`core/signals.py`)|**suggestions:**|- **Welcome Email:** You've outlined a placeholder for sending a welcome email. Implement this using Django’s email backend or integrate with an external service like SendGrid for better deliverability.
core_app_signals_(`core/signals.py`)|**suggestions:**|- **Signal Efficiency:** Use `select_related` or `prefetch_related` if fetching related data within signals to optimize database queries.
leveling_app_signals_(`leveling/signals.py`)|**review:**|- The signals to update skill levels and recalculate levels and tiers after a `SkillLevel` save are crucial for keeping the game mechanics consistent.
leveling_app_signals_(`leveling/signals.py`)|**review:**|- The use of logging to track the operations and errors is well implemented.
leveling_app_signals_(`leveling/signals.py`)|**suggestions:**|- **Atomic Transactions:** You're using atomic transactions, which is great. Ensure all parts of the transaction are covered correctly to avoid partial updates.
leveling_app_signals_(`leveling/signals.py`)|**suggestions:**|- **Calculation Logic:** Review the `calculate_new_tier` and `calculate_new_level` logic regularly to ensure it scales with any new game mechanics or rules you introduce.
prompt_app_signals_(`prompt/signals.py`)|**review:**|- Handling updates to character states upon prompt completions helps keep character data fresh and reactive to user interactions.
prompt_app_signals_(`prompt/signals.py`)|**suggestions:**|- **Expand Signal Use:** Consider expanding the use of signals to handle more complex interactions, such as achievements unlocked via prompts or integrating analytics updates here.
subscription_app_signals_(`subscription/signals.py`)|**review:**|- The signal handling for subscription updates and deletions is robust, especially with the integration of user service notifications.
subscription_app_signals_(`subscription/signals.py`)|**suggestions:**|- **Enhanced Feedback:** Provide immediate feedback to users upon subscription status changes via email or in-app notifications.
subscription_app_signals_(`subscription/signals.py`)|**suggestions:**|- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around subscription changes, especially when external services like payment gateways are involved.
